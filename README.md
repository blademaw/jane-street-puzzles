# Jane Street puzzles

Every month, quantitative trading firm [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/) publishes [a puzzle](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/current-puzzle/) typically requiring logic, computer science, or math techniques to solve. Sometimes I try to solve these puzzles, and depending on the difficulty, I may upload my solution to this repository.

## Solve history

(in reverse chronological order; note that _difficulty_ is my opinion and relativeâ€”even "easy" problems are often nontrivial)
